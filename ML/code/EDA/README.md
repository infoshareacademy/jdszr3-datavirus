### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Machine Learning project "Mushroom classification" based on Kaggle dataset.  

#### Key takeaways:
* _No null values_
* _8124 observations, 23 columns (out of which 22 features)_
* _Classification - edible (0) or poisonous (1)_
* _52% of mushrooms in the dataset are edible_
* _Dataset trimmed to 7 features, the most accessible for the app user_

#### Machine Learning model deployed:
* _Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVC and Logistc Regression_
* _The weakest (0.89) accuracy was provided by Logistic Regression_
* _DT/RF/SVC/KNN with very comparable accuracy and F1 scores_
* _The most important features concerned: bruises, cap shape & surface, gill spacing_
