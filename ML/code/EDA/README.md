### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Machine Learning project "Mushroom classification" based on Kaggle dataset.  

#### Key takeaways:
* _No null values_
* _8124 rows and 23 columns_
* _Classification - edible (0) or poisonous (1) mushroom_
* _52% of mushrooms are edible_
* _7 out of 22 features are "final one" - the most accessible for the app user_

#### Deployed models:
* _Decision Trees, KNN, SVC, Random Forest, Logistic Regression_
* _The lowest accuracy in Logistic Regression (89%) vs the best one in KNN (97%) _
* _Top 3 features in each model: bruises, cap color & cap surface, gill spacing _
